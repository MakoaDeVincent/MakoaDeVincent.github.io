In 2016 I graduated college and received my Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. This was the moment I’ve been waiting for! Now I could go out into the world and use that degree to get a job and do what ever Interdisciplinary Studies majors do!

But what do they do…? Well I didn't know the answer to that, and I still don't really know!

So… I decided to start my own business. For four years I ran my own small business, where I screen printed shirts for other people, companies, etc. It had its ups and downs, but I eventually grew tired. I was tired of the mundane, never changing days that I spent printing shirts. I wanted something bigger, better, and more meaningful!

This is where coding comes in. Throughout my 4 years of college, I’ve for some reason always came back to learning HTML and CSS in my free time. I would look up youtube videos and free little courses that taught the basics of these languages. It was also in this time that I realized the possibilities of software development and developed a small passion for it. A passion that would remain within me.

I remembered this passion I felt, and started learning to code again while I was working. And one day I remembered asking myself, “Are you sure you want to print shirts for the rest of your life?” my answer was, “no.”

In December of 2019, I decided to quit my job and enroll in Flatiron School, full-time. 
And here I am now, one week into the program. 

All this to say: I chose to study Software Engineering because of its endless possibilities. I see Software Engineering as an exciting tool to potentially change people’s lives for the better. If I could learn to do that, I couldn't ask for more.
