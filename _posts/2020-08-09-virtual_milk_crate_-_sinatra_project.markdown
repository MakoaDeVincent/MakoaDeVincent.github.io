Our second project of the Flatiron curriculum was to create a web app that uses Sinatra and Active Record. I decided to go with a Vinyl Record Library app, that allows you to log in and add, view, edit, and delete the vinyl records in your collection. 

When starting this project, I had to remember CRUD.
C-Creating vinyl records
R-Reading the vinyl records that were created.
U-Updating and changing the information of an existing vinyl record
D-Deleting or Removing a vinyl record from your collection.

It was extremely exciting to finally make something that can be seen on a webpage. It really brings to life all of the hard work that Iâ€™ve put in to studying and learning. 

Something huge that I learned during this project was seeing how all of our routes are connected. When we went over RESTful routes during our lessons and labs, I kind of got the gist of it, but it was when I wrote my project from scratch that I feel like it finally clicked. I finally understood how our GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE methods, were communicating with our views/erb files to create the library of vinyl records for the user. I also feel like something else clicked for me and it was just understanding overall how to make our code communicate with each other to make one final web app. 

I am excited to learn more and improve!
