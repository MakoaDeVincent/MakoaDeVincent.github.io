I finally finished my CLI project! And what an exciting process it was! I was able to work through the nervousness and self doubt; and was able to watch everything I had learned up to this point, come to life!

Our CLI project requires us to make a CLI app that goes “one level” deep into an API and provides the user with a set of data. For my CLI project, I wanted to do something that I was interested in and I wanted it to be something that I would potentially use. So I decided to make Beer Near Me! Where you can find local breweries in your City, select a brewery, and get information on that Brewery such as their address, phone number, and website!

Throughout the project, I was able to use everything I had learned from our lectures and labs to create this application, I was able to access an API, use object relationships, and so much more! But, even though I was using everything I had previously learned I was still able to learn FROM this project.

When creating my application, I learned how to process and map out my methods and how they would be called and when they would be called, to ultimately make my application work. I think that you can read about good practices and how you should plan your project, but nothing beats learning this from experience. I was able to get stuck, confused and lost in my code; this allowed me to slow down and write meaningful code. And was once I was able to do that, I was able to refactor my code easier and was also able to easier understand how everything was working together in my application.

I’m glad I was able to trust the process, and even learn while making my CLI Project!
