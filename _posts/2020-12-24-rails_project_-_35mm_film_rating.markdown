I finally finished my Rails Project! It's cool to slowly see how everything I've been learning up to this point is making its way into the apps I'm creating. This project was quite a bit more difficult than the other projects we've done, but it definitely was the most fullfilling up to this point. 

Something I really struggled with was planning out my project, It took me a while to figure out my associations; it's something I need more practice with, but I know that it will come in time. But, affter I got my associations up and running, I was able to start actually working on my project! After working on my Controllers, Models, and Views I was able to create an app from scratch which I could see myself using! (it still needs a lot of work though, especially in the styling department.)

I remember earlier in the course, I doubted myself a lot. I struggled with whether or not I was grasping all of the information being taught; in fact, sometimes I still do! But when I'm able to create my working app, I feel like all that doubting and worrying was for nothing. It definitely was'nt easy, and I still got frustrated throughout the project. But being able to finish it, is what reminds me that I need to trust the process and that I'm also making progress!
